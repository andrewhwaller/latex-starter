# latex-starter
This is a template for conference papers written using LaTeX so I don't have to rewrite the configuration every time. Only things that might need to be changed other than whatever packages you do or don't want to use is the path for your citation manager. I use Zotero and have it set up accordingly for what I have on my machines, but you may need to do that differently.

The `gitignore` is the standard `TeX` template that GitHub generates, so WYSIWYG.
